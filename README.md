# Refactored Grade Submission System API

## Introduction

Hello Everyone,

I am delighted to present the next iteration of my Grade Submission System, now evolved into a comprehensive API. Leveraging the knowledge gained from the initial project, I embarked on a journey to bring more scalability, security, and robustness to the application.

## Project Overview

In this refactored version:

- **API Centric Design**: Transitioned from a unified codebase to a fully-fledged API, allowing for more versatile interactions and integrations.
  
- **Enhanced Security**: Implemented JWT Tokenized Authentication, ensuring a secure environment for users and their data.
  
- **Database Integration with JPA/Hibernate**: Opted for the power of JPA and Hibernate for efficient data handling and persistence, providing scalability and performance improvements.
  
- **End-to-End Testing**: Expanded on the initial unit tests with integration tests to verify the seamless operation of the entire system.

## Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot**: Continues to be the backbone, offering the ease of creating powerful applications.
  
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Integrated for efficient ORM capabilities, ensuring smooth data operations.
  
- **JWT**: For secure and stateless authentication, ensuring data privacy and system security.
  
- **JUnit & Mockito**: Retained for robust testing, now expanded to include more complex scenarios.

## Refactor Insights

### Embracing the API-first Approach

In acknowledging the need for more modularity and the increasing demand for API-driven applications, this project was refactored to be API-centric. This change paves the way for more versatile frontends, from web to mobile and even third-party integrations.

### Data Persistence with JPA/Hibernate

Transitioning from a more rudimentary data handling method, JPA and Hibernate were introduced. This not only ensures efficient data transactions but also provides flexibility with varied database choices.

### Security with JWT

Understanding the criticality of user data and application security, JWT tokenized authentication was implemented. This step ensures that user interactions with the application are secure and verified.

## Conclusion

This refactored project signifies my adaptability and continuous learning in the software development arena. It stands as a testament to my readiness for more advanced roles, where the focus shifts from not just building but optimizing and securing applications.

I cordially invite you to delve into this repository and see the transformation firsthand. My hope is that it highlights my enthusiasm for growth, innovation, and my commitment to delivering excellence.

Looking forward to the prospects of further collaborations and mutual growth.

Warm Regards,
